# BaumhardtBot
A telegram bot made for fun with some Eliza functionality.  
It will be changed to speak german in the near future.

## Build instructions
1. Install the maven dependencies in your preferred way (i use NetBeans).
2. Copy the "config.example.json" file inside the "conf" folder to another file called "config.json"
3. Add your telegram bot token to the file you just created.
4. Compile and run the project in your preferred way (i use NetBeans again).
